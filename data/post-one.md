Post Code Injection
===================

We've just added Code Injection to posts and pages in Ghost, so you can add custom styles and scripts to the header and footer of individual articles.

A Second Level Header
---------------------
A while back we introduced Code Injection for Ghost as an easy way to insert styles, scripts, and arbitrary snippets of code into the header and footer of a site without needing to edit any theme files.

Now, we've also added the fields at a post level for when you want to use one-off style, script or snippet of code but don't want to include it across the entire site. This comes in particularly handy when using interactive embeds and elements, or when you want custom styles for art-directed posts, like this one.
